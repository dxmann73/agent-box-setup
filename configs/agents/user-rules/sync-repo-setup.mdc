description: Steps to synchronize repo-level agent and tooling setup

# Repo sync setup

- Synchronize only repo-level files (for example `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, project docs, and local conventions).
- Keep synchronization focused on repo content and project conventions.
- Determine the current tool stack and keep `AGENTS.md` aligned with the relevant skills and rules.
- Preserve existing project structure and preferences; avoid destructive overwrites.
- If sync inputs conflict, ask for direction before changing policy-level files.
