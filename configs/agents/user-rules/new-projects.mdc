description: Steps for creating new projects and repos in GitHub

# New project setup

- Create or update a repo-local `AGENTS.md` with project-specific guidance.
- For Claude compatibility, provide `CLAUDE.md` as a symlink to `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep GitHub repositories private by default unless the user asks for public visibility.
- Determine the project stack and include only the relevant skills/rules references.
- Reuse existing project conventions and avoid broad rewrites when bootstrapping.
